This is the source code for an indie videogame I made in Unity

I originally began with wanting to create a half RPG/half platformer videogame in Unity, so I first watched a tutorial to get myself acquainted with the platform

Then, I used the knowledge gained from that tutorial to make a mock-RPG game. It had player and enemy healths, with each entity being able to attack, heal, and raise their abilities.

Here is a video of the working turn-based combat: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14AreNRUGKDOy48ofZXqqyN_CZCw2VQJY/view?usp=sharing

Next, I started learning how to make platforming using this tutorial

However, halfway through the tutorial I realized I wanted to switch to just a platformer.

From there, I used unity documentation and my previous knowledge from videos to create a fun video game complete with artwork, free sounds, and a story.

*Tilemapping*

When I was first learning to code, I made a platformer using pygame with a tutorial. It was really fun and helped me learn python, but level creation was really hard as I had to create each level making a grid in a csv file and then loading that into the game. The coolest thing I learned about Unity in my creation process was tilemaps, which allow you to preset functions and variables to "grids" and then place whatever assets wherever you want on the screen using that grid and they automatically inherit the traits of that tilemap.

*C#*

Before this project, I had never coded in C# before, so I learned a lot about how it is a component based OOP language, and how to use the interface of PlayerPrefs in Unity to pass variables and information across scripts and scenes.

This is the source code for an indie videogame I made in Unity

I originally began with wanting to create a half RPG/half platformer videogame in Unity, so I first watched a tutorial to get myself acquainted with the platform

Then, I used the knowledge gained from that tutorial to make a mock-RPG game. It had player and enemy healths, with each entity being able to attack, heal, and raise their abilities.

Next, I started learning how to make platforming using this tutorial

However, halfway through the tutorial I realized I wanted to switch to just a platformer.

From there, I used unity documentation and my previous knowledge from videos to create a fun video game complete with artwork, free sounds, and a story.
